  Sometimes you’ve got a single huge function that does a lot of work. The temptation is to split it up, refactor it, and make it more “readable”. But remember, whatever you do, whether the code sits in a single function or in a hundred of them, the work still has to be done.
</p>
<p>
  If you can’t detect duplicate code that you can put in a separate function, or extract patterns that you can also use elsewhere, what is your goal? Sure, everybody knows that a function with over a thousand lines is bad. So you split it up in pieces, right? Are you sure that the quality of the code has improved?
</p>
<p>
  Or are you just warding off potential criticism? A thousand-line function is bad, so instead, you write 50 functions of 20 lines each. Now the metrics look fine and the linter is satisfied. But is it better now? Who on your team has the wisdom and experience to offer truly inspired advice in a code review?
