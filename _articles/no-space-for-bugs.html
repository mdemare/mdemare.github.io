<p>
In the previous article about <code>maph</code> and <code>Enumerator#key</code>, I didn't motivate why I believed that these methods,
which add no functionality and purely allow code to be written slightly differently, are worthwhile. You can plot these different approaches on a chart.
Somewhere to the left is the for-loop (when asked about adding functions like <code>map</code>,
Rob Pike, the creator of Go, said "Just use a for-loop"). Then we have <code>each</code> or <code>forEach</code> with a block, then <code>map</code>
itself, and then to the right is Ruby's symbol notation, <code>select(&:even?)</code>. Finally, far to the right, there's Lisp.
</p>
<p>
Look at these fragments:
</p>
<pre>
# 1) c-style for loop
names = []
for(int i=0; i < len(users); i++) {
  names.append(users[i]["name"])
}

# 2) for loop
names = []
for h in users
  names.push(h["name"])
end

# 3) each
names = []
users.each {|h| names.push(h["name"]) }

# 4) map
names = users.map {|h| h["name"] }

# 5) maph
names = users.maph("name")
</pre>

<p>
I would argue that the essential property that changes in these examples is not primarily code length.
Nor is it readability, which is in the eye of the beholder; I bet there are many programmers that would argue that
the for-loop is much more readable than the <code>maph</code> example.
</p>

<p>
What actually changes is that the examples are progressively less like code. Technically, of course, there is no
difference. But I can refer to "the set of first names of my co-workers" without saying what they are or
mentioning a procedure to enumerate them. And similarly, I can refer to <code>users.maph("name")</code>. It is a
recipe for producing the names of these data structures with user data, but simultaneously, it is the thing itself.
</p>

<p>
Nor is there any space for bugs in <code>users.maph("name")</code>. Which is not to say that it does what you want - maybe
<code>name</code> doesn't refer to the kind of name you need, maybe <code>users</code> contains
<code>User</code> objects instead of hashes, maybe some of them are nil. So, yes, the "What" aspect may still be incorrect. But the "How" aspect is simply Not Interesting - there is nothing to debug,
nothing to review.
</p>

<p>In a way, the goal is to have a declarative language for basic operations on arrays and hashes, just like there is XPath for XML, selectors for CSS,
  and <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> for JSON.
</p>

<p>
  It isn't a coincidence that the last example, <code>names = users.maph("name")</code> can be rewritten in Ruby on Rails as <code>names = User.pluck(:name)</code> which runs the SQL query <code>SELECT name FROM users</code> which looks a lot like the last example, but very little like the for loop. SQL, of course, is a declarative language - we specify the *what* not the *how*, just like in the <code>maph</code> example.
</p>

<p>
  When you use abstractions that correspond to the domain of relational tables, you don't just make it easier to port that part of the code to a relational database. You also "prime" other developers to think of this code in the familiar terms of relational algebra, together with the entire toolset that's associated with it. If you can use <code>maph</code>, then you should also be able to trivially filter, sort by, group, count, and perform various types of joins.
